							<h2>Scrum</h2>
							<p>Scrum is a management and control process that cuts through complexity to focus on building software that meets business needs. Management and teams are able to get their hands around the requirements and technologies, never let go, and deliver working software, incrementally and empirically. Scrum itself is a simple framework for effective team collaboration on complex software projects.  Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland have written The Scrum Guide to explain Scrum clearly and succinctly. Scrum is most often used to manage complex software and product development, using iterative and incremental practices. Scrum significantly increases productivity and reduces time to benefits relative to classic “waterfall” processes.</p>

						      <p>What is a Scrum Master? The ScrumMaster is responsible for making sure a Scrum team lives by the values and practices of Scrum. The ScrumMaster is often considered a coach for the team, helping the team do the best work it possibly can. The ScrumMaster can also be thought of as a <em>process owner</em> for the team, creating a balance with the project's key stakeholder, who is referred to as the product owner.</p>
									<p>The ScrumMaster does anything possible to help the team perform at their highest level. This involves removing any impediments to progress, facilitating meetings, and doing things like working with the product owner to make sure the product backlog is in good shape and ready for the next sprint. The ScrumMaster role is commonly filled by a former project manager or a technical team leader but can be anyone.</p>
									<p>The ScrumMaster is also often viewed as a protector of the team. The most common example is that the ScrumMaster protects the team by making sure they do not over-commit themselves to what they can achieve during a sprint due to pressure from an overly aggressive product owner. However, a good ScrumMaster also protects the team from complacency.</p>
									<p>What is a Scrum Master role and how does it fit into the project? Many who are new to the ScrumMaster role struggle with the apparent contradiction of the ScrumMaster as both a servant-leader to the team and also someone with no authority. The seeming contradiction disappears when we realize that although the ScrumMaster has no authority over Scrum team members, the ScrumMaster does have authority over the process. Although a ScrumMaster may not be able to say, “You’re fired,” a ScrumMaster can say, “I’ve decided we’re going to try two-week sprints for the next month.”</p>
									<p>The ScrumMaster is there to help the team in its use of Scrum. Think of the help from a ScrumMaster as similar to a personal trainer who helps you stick with an exercise regimen and perform all exercises with the correct form. A good trainer will provide motivation while at the same time making sure you don’t cheat by skipping a hard exercise. The trainer’s authority, however, is limited. The trainer cannot make you do an exercise you don’t want to do. Instead, the trainer reminds you of your goals and how you’ve chosen to meet them. To the extent that the trainer does have authority, it has been granted by the client. ScrumMasters are much the same: They have authority, but that authority is granted to them by the team.</p>
									<p>A ScrumMaster can say to a team, “Look, we’re supposed to deliver potentially shippable software at the end of each sprint. We didn’t do that this time. What can we do to make sure we do better the next sprint?” This is the ScrumMaster exerting authority over the process; something has gone wrong with the process if the team has failed to deliver something potentially shippable.</p>
									<p>But because the ScrumMaster’s authority does not extend beyond the process, the same ScrumMaster should not say, “Because we failed to deliver something potentially shippable the last sprint, I want Tod to review all code before it gets checked in.” Having Tod review the code might be a good idea, but the decision is not the ScrumMaster’s to make. Doing so goes beyond authority over the process and enters into how the team works.</p>
									<p>With authority limited to ensuring the team follows the process, the ScrumMaster’s role can be more difficult than that of a typical project manager. Project managers often have the fallback position of “do it because I say so.” The times when a ScrumMaster can say that are limited and restricted to ensuring that Scrum is being followed.</p>

						    	<p>A Scrum team in a Scrum environment does not include any of the traditional software engineering roles such as programmer, designer, tester or architect. Everyone on the project works together to complete the set of work they have collectively committed to complete within a sprint. Because of this, Scrum teams develop a deep form of camaraderie and a feeling that "we're all in this together."</p>
									<p>Former roles in traditional teams often adapt to an agile role that makes them an integral Scrum team member who retains some of the aspects of their prior role, but also adds new traits as well. New roles in a Scrum team are the ScrumMaster or product owner. You can find out more about which role in a Scrum team would suit you here by finding your pre-agile role.</p>
									<p>A typical Scrum team is five to nine people. Rather than scaling by having a large team, Scrum projects scale through having teams of teams. In this way, we have worked on projects with more than 500 people and have consulted on projects with more than 1,000.</p>
									<p>Although it's not the only thing necessary to scale Scrum, one well-known technique is the use of a "Scrum of Scrums" meeting. With this approach, each Scrum team proceeds as normal, but each team identifies one person who attends the Scrum of Scrums meeting to coordinate the work of multiple Scrum teams. These meetings are analogous to the daily Scrum meeting, but do not necessarily happen every day. In many organizations, having a Scrum of Scrums meeting two or three times a week is sufficient.</p>
									<p>The illustration below shows how a Scrum of Scrums approach allows Scrum to scale up (in this case to 243 people). Each cell represents one person on a Scrum team. The bottom of this illustration shows teams with nine developers on them. One person from each team (the differently colored cell) also participates in a Scrum of Scrum to coordinate work above that team. Then from those nine-person teams, another person is selected (this time shown with diagonal lines) to participate in what is called a Scrum of Scrums of Scrums.</p>

						  		<p>The Scrum product owner is typically a project's key stakeholder. Part of the product owner responsibilities is to have a vision of what he or she wishes to build, and convey that vision to the scrum team. This is key to successfully starting any agile software development project. The agile product owner does this in part through the product backlog, which is a prioritized features list for the product.</p>
									<p>The product owner is commonly a lead user of the system or someone from marketing, product management or anyone with a solid understanding of users, the market place, the competition and of future trends for the domain or type of system being developed.</p>
									<p>This, of course, varies tremendously based on whether the team is developing commercial software, software for internal use, hardware or some other type of product. The key is that the person in the product owner role needs to have a vision for what is to be built.</p>
									<p>Although the agile PO prioritizes the product backlog during the sprint planning meeting, the team selects the amount of work they believe they can do during each sprint, and how many sprints will be required.</p>
									<p>The product owner does not get to say, "We have four sprints left, therefore you must do one-fourth of the product backlog this sprint." The Scrum product owner's job is to motivate the team with a clear, elevating goal. Team members know best what they are capable of, and so they select which user stories from the top of the product backlog they can commit to delivering during any sprint.</p>
									<p>In return for the Scrum team's commitment to completing the selected user stories from the top of the product backlog, the product owner makes a reciprocal commitment to not throw new requirements at the team during the sprint. Requirements are allowed to change (and change is encouraged) but only outside the sprint. Once the team starts on a sprint, it remains maniacally focused on the goal of that sprint.</p>
									<p>
									The product owner role requires an individual with certain skills and traits, including availability, business savvy and communication skills. First, the Scrum product owner needs to be available to his or her team. The best product owners show commitment by doing whatever is necessary to build the best product possible and that means being actively engaged with their teams.</p>
									<p>
									Business savvy is important for the agile product owner because he or she is the decision maker regarding what features the product will have. That means, the agile PO should understand the market, the customer and the business in order to make sound decisions.</p>
									<p>Finally, communication is a large part of the product owner responsibilities. The product owner role requires working closely with key stakeholders throughout the organization and beyond, so he or she must be able to communicate different messages to different people about the project at any given time.</p>

						  		<p>Product backlog refinement sometimes called product backlog grooming in reference to keeping the backlog clean and orderly is a meeting that is held near the end of one sprint to ensure the backlog is ready for the next sprint.</p>
									<p>During a product backlog refinement meeting, the team and product owner discuss the top items on the product backlog. The team is given a chance to ask the questions that would normally arise during sprint planning:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>What should we do if the user enters invalid data here?</li>
										<li>Are all users allowed to access this part of the system?</li>
										<li>What happens if…?</li>
									</ul>
									<p>By asking these questions earlier, the product owner is given a chance to arrive at answers to any questions he or she may not be prepared to answer immediately.</p>
									<p>If those questions were asked for the first time in sprint planning, and too many could not be answered, it might be necessary to put a high-priority product backlog item aside and not work on it during the sprint.</p>
									<p>These questions do not need to be fully resolved in a backlog refinement meeting. Rather, the product owner needs only to address them just enough so that the team feels confident that the story can be adequately discussed during the coming planning meeting.</p>
									<p>Backlog refinement in that sense is really a checkpoint rather than an effort to fully resolve issues.</p>
									<p>I like to hold the product backlog refinement meetings three days before the end of the current sprint. This gives the product owner sufficient time to act on any issues that are identified. Some teams find that doing shorter meetings every week rather than once per sprint are more suited to their cadence, and that is, of course, fine.</p>
									<p>Unlike other Scrum meetings, I do not think the product backlog refinement meeting requires the participation of the whole team.</p>
									<p>If you think about a whole team meeting three days before the end of the sprint, there is likely to be someone who will be frantically busy someone who, if forced to attend one more meeting, may have to work late to finish the work of the sprint.</p>
									<p>I’d prefer to conduct the meeting without such team members. As long as the same team members don’t miss the meeting each sprint, I think it’s fine to conduct backlog refinement meetings with about half the team plus the product owner and ScrumMaster.</p>

						      <p>In Scrum, the sprint planning meeting is attended by the product owner, ScrumMaster and the entire Scrum team. Outside stakeholders may attend by invitation of the team, although this is rare in most companies.</p>
									<p>During the sprint planning meeting, the product owner describes the highest priority features to the team. The team asks enough questions that they can turn a high-level user story of the product backlog into the more detailed tasks of the sprint backlog.</p>
									<p>The product owner doesn't have to describe every item being tracked on the product backlog. A good guideline is for the product owner to come to the sprint planning meeting prepared to talk about two sprint's worth of product backlog items. To make an example really simple, suppose a team always finishes five product backlog items. Their product owner should enter the meeting prepared to talk about the top 10 priorities.</p>
									<p>There are two defined artifacts that result from a sprint planning meeting:</p>
									<ol>
										<li>A sprint goal</li>
										<li>A sprint backlog</li>
									</ol>
									<p>A sprint goal is a short, one- or two-sentence, description of what the team plans to achieve during the sprint. It is written collaboratively by the team and the product owner. The following are example sprint goals on an eCommerce application:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Implement basic shopping cart functionality including add, remove, and update quantities.</li>
										<li>Develop the checkout process: pay for an order, pick shipping, order gift wrapping, etc.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>The sprint goal can be used for quick reporting to those outside the sprint. There are always stakeholders who want to know what the team is working on, but who do not need to hear about each product backlog item (user story) in detail. The success of the sprint will later be assessed during the sprint review meeting against the sprint goal, rather than against each specific item selected from the product backlog.</p>
									<p>The sprint backlog is the other output of sprint planning. A sprint backlog is a list of the product backlog items the team commits to delivering <em>plus </em>the list of tasks necessary to delivering those product backlog items. Each task on the sprint backlog is also usually estimated.</p>
									<p>An important point to reiterate here is that it's the team that selects how much work they can do in the coming sprint. The product owner does not get to say, "We have four sprints left so you need to do one-fourth of everything I need." We can hope the team does that much (or more), but it's up to the team to determine how much they can do in the sprint.</p>

						      <p>In Scrum, on each day of a sprint, the team holds a daily scrum meeting called the "daily scrum.” Meetings are typically held in the same location and at the same time each day. Ideally, a daily scrum meeting is held in the morning, as it helps set the context for the coming day's work. These scrum meetings are strictly time-boxed to 15 minutes. This keeps the discussion brisk but relevant.</p>
									<p>There is an old joke in which a chicken and a pig are talking that illustrates a key concept in the daily scrum ...</p>
									<p>Chicken: "Let's start a restaurant."<br>
									Pig: "Good idea, but what should we call it?"<br>
									Chicken: "How about 'Ham and Eggs'"<br>
									Pig: "No thanks. I'd be committed, you'd only be involved."</p>
									<p>The joke is meant to point out the difference between those who are committed on a project and those who are only involved. Scrum affords special status to those who are committed, and many teams enforce a rule in which only those who are committed are allowed to talk during the daily scrum meeting.</p>
									<p>All team members are required to attend scrum meetings. Since both the ScrumMaster and product owner are committed team members, they are expected to attend and participate. Anyone else (for example, a departmental VP, a salesperson or a developer from another project) is allowed to attend, but is there only to listen. This makes scrum meetings an excellent way for a Scrum team to disseminate information -- if you're interested in hearing where things are at, attend that day's meeting.</p>
									<p>The daily scrum meeting is not used as a problem-solving or issue resolution meeting. Issues that are raised are taken offline and usually dealt with by the relevant subgroup immediately after the meeting. During the daily scrum, each team member answers the following three questions:</p>
									<ol>
										<li>What did you do yesterday?</li>
										<li>What will you do today?</li>
										<li>Are there any impediments in your way?</li>
									</ol>
									<p>By focusing on what each person accomplished yesterday and will accomplish today, the team gains an excellent understanding of what work has been done and what work remains. The daily scrum meeting is not a status update meeting in which a boss is collecting information about who is behind schedule. Rather, it is a meeting in which team members make commitments to each other.</p>
									<p>If a programmer stands up and says, "Today, I will finish the data storage module," everyone knows that in tomorrow's meeting, he will say whether or not he finished. This has the wonderful effect of helping a team realize the significance of these commitments, and that their commitments are to <em>one another,</em> not to some far-off customer or salesman.</p>
									<p>Any impediments that are raised in the scrum meeting become the ScrumMaster's responsibility to resolve as quickly as possible. Typical impediments are:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>My ____ broke and I need a new one today.</li>
										<li>I still haven't got the software I ordered a month ago.</li>
										<li>I need help debugging a problem with ______.</li>
										<li>I'm struggling to learn ______ and would like to pair with someone on it.</li>
										<li>I can't get the vendor's tech support group to call me back.</li>
										<li>Our new contractor can't start because no one is here to sign her contract.</li>
										<li>I can't get the ____ group to give me any time and I need to meet with them.</li>
										<li>The department VP has asked me to work on something else "for a day or two."</li>
									</ul>
									<p>In cases where the ScrumMaster cannot remove these impediments directly himself (e.g., usually the more technical issues), he still takes responsibility for making sure someone on the team does quickly resolve the issue.</p>
									<p>The vast majority of teams conduct the daily scrum meeting by having each person answer the three questions in order. You answer all three, then the next person, the next and so on. An interesting alternative that some teams find helpful is to talk through one product backlog item before moving on to the next. In this way, an individual may give an update at multiple different times during the same meeting.</p>

						    	<p>In Scrum, each sprint is required to deliver a potentially shippable product increment. This means that at the end of each sprint, the team has produced a coded, tested and usable piece of software.</p>
									<p>So at the end of each sprint, a sprint review meeting is held. During this meeting, the Scrum team shows what they accomplished during the sprint. Typically this takes the form of a demo of the new features.</p>
									<p>The sprint review meeting is intentionally kept very informal, typically with rules forbidding the use of PowerPoint slides and allowing no more than two hours of preparation time for the meeting. A sprint review meeting should not become a distraction or significant detour for the team; rather, it should be a natural result of the sprint.</p>
									<p>Participants in the sprint review typically include the product owner, the Scrum team, the ScrumMaster, management, customers and developers from other projects.</p>
									<p>During the sprint review, the project is assessed against the sprint goal determined during the sprint planning meeting. Ideally, the team has completed each product backlog item brought into the sprint, but it's more important that they achieve the overall goal of the sprint.</p>

						     <p>No matter how good a Scrum team is, there is always opportunity to improve. Although a good Scrum team will be constantly looking for improvement opportunities, the team should set aside a brief, dedicated period at the end of each sprint to deliberately reflect on how they are doing and to find ways to improve. This occurs during the sprint retrospective.</p>
									<p>The sprint retrospective is usually the last thing done in a sprint. Many teams will do it immediately after the sprint review. The entire team, including both the ScrumMaster and the product owner should participate. You can schedule a scrum retrospective for up to an hour, which is usually quite sufficient. However, occasionally a hot topic will arise or a team conflict will escalate and the retrospective could take significantly longer.</p>
									<p>Although there are many ways to conduct an agile sprint retrospective, our recommendation is to conduct it as a start-stop-continue meeting. This is perhaps the simplest, but often the most effective way to conduct a retrospective. Using this approach each team member is asked to identify specific things that the team should:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Start doing</li>
										<li>Stop doing</li>
										<li>Continue doing</li>
									</ul>
									<p>There are many variations on this simple format. The ScrumMaster can facilitate this sprint retrospective meeting by asking everyone to just shout out ideas during the scrum. The ScrumMaster can go around the room asking each person to identify any one thing to start, stop or continue. Or, for example, he or she can tell everyone to focus on identifying something to stop this time because not much attention has been paid to things to stop in recent retrospectives.<br><br>
									After an initial list of ideas has been brainstormed, teams will commonly vote on specific items to focus on during the coming sprint. At the end of the sprint, the next retrospective is often begun by reviewing the list of things selected for attention in the prior sprint retrospective.</p>

						    	<p>The agile product backlog in Scrum is a prioritized features list, containing short descriptions of all functionality desired in the product. When applying Scrum, it's not necessary to start a project with a lengthy, upfront effort to document all requirements. Typically, a Scrum team and its product owner begin by writing down everything they can think of for agile backlog prioritization. This agile product backlog is almost always more than enough for a first sprint. The Scrum product backlog is then allowed to grow and change as more is learned about the product and its customers.</p>
									<p>A typical Scrum backlog comprises the following different types of items:</p>
									<ol>
										<li>Features</li>
										<li>Bugs</li>
										<li>Technical work</li>
										<li>Knowledge acquisition</li>
									</ol>
									<p>By far, the predominant way for a Scrum team to express features on the agile product backlog is in the form of user stories, which are short, simple descriptions of the desired functionality told from perspective of the user. An example would be, "As a shopper, I can review the items in my shopping cart before checking out so that I can see what I've already selected."</p>
									<p>Because there's really no difference between a bug and a new feature -- each describes something different that a user wants bugs are also put on the Scrum product backlog</p>
									<p>Technical work and knowledge acquisition activities also belong on the agile backlog. An example of technical work would be, "Upgrade all developers' workstations to Windows 7." An example of knowledge acquisition could be a Scrum backlog item about researching various JavaScript libraries and making a selection.</p>
									<p>The product owner shows up at the sprint planning meeting with the prioritized agile product backlog and describes the top items to the team. The team then determines which items they can complete during the coming sprint. The team then moves items from the product backlog to the sprint backlog. In doing so, they expand each Scrum product backlog item into one or more sprint backlog tasks so they can more effectively share work during the sprint.</p>

						    	<p>An Impediment is anything that keeps the Team from getting work Done and that slows Velocity.

						    	<p>Impediments An Impediment is anything that keeps the Team from getting work Done and that slows Velocity. Impediments come in many forms: a sick team member, a missing resource, lack of management support or even a cold team room</p>
						    	<p>A hindrance or obstruction to doing something. Frequently used to describe some issue or blocker that is preventing a team or organization from performing Scrum in an effective way.</p>
						    	<p>Most Impediments are a form of Waste and can be identified by understanding waste in all its forms. The slides have a list of common Impediments Teams often run into.</p>
									<p>The Scrum Master’s main responsibility is to identify, track and help remove impediments. Often, team members remove their own impediments. Sometimes, Impediments are beyond the ability of the Team to remove. In that case, the Scrum Master may have to get support from outside of the Team.</p>
									<p>Everyone on the Team shares responsibility for identifying Impediments. All Impediments should be flagged during the Daily Scrum. Reoccurring Impediments should be dealt with during the Sprint Retrospective. If an Impediment just won't go away, the Team probably hasn't identified the root cause and should begin the A3 process.</p>
									<p>It is vital for Teams to continually identify new impediments. This is part of a key concept in Scrum: continuous improvement. Not having a clearly identified impediment for the team to work on is itself a major impediment.</p>
